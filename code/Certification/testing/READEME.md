# Setup
This directory is for testing purposes and not in the final product. The goal of the two files in this repository is to generate the artifacts needed by the `/Start` and `/Mint` tools.

In the `participants.json` we can add participants. The `generate-test-data.ts` file will convert this file and write `Data/merkleData.ts` which is used by the `/Mint` tool.
